        I designed and built the website for a software factory company using
        React. I handled everything on the frontend — from making sure the
        design looked great on all screen sizes to optimizing the site for
        performance and search engines.
        <br />
        <br />
        The project also included an admin panel where the team could manage
        blog posts and admin users. I connected the frontend to the API
        throughout the site to pull in dynamic content and make everything work
        smoothly. Overall, the site gave the company a modern, responsive, and
        easy-to-manage online presence.
